Development of supervillain began during a visit supported by the `Simons Collaboration on Confinement and QCD Strings <https://simonsconfinementcollaboration.org/>`_.
The work of Evan Berkowitz was performed in part at the Aspen Center for Physics, which is supported by National Science Foundation grant PHY-2210452, during a stay supported by `CASA, the Centre for Advanced Simulation and Analytics <https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/research/research-fields/information/supercomputing/copy_of_casa-centre-for-advanced-simulation-and-analytics>`_ of Forschungszentrum Jülich.

We gratefully acknowledge computing time on the supercomputer JURECA :cite:`jureca:2021` at Forschungszentrum Jülich through the VSR grant 30278.
