License
=======

supervillain is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
However, we may incorporate some work licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).
The AGPL's clause 13 explicitly allows combination into works that are GPLv3, though that portion of the combined work maintains its AGPL licensing.
The full text of both the GPL and AGPL are provided in the LICENSES directory.

While supervillain is released under the GPL, certain included icons, logos, or graphical elements may be trademarked and are not covered under the GPL license.
Specifically, under section 7 of the GPL, trademarks and any associated rights are not granted under this license.

This means that while you are free to use, modify, and distribute supervillain in accordance with the GPL, the use of any trademarked icons or logos must comply with the applicable trademark laws and usage guidelines established by the trademark holder.
Any unauthorized use of these trademarked elements may result in a violation of trademark rights.
