class Bootstrap(H5able):
    r'''
    The bootstrap is a resampling technique for estimating uncertainties.

    For samples with weights :math:`w` the expectation value of an observable is

    .. math::
        \left\langle O \right\rangle = \frac{\left\langle O w \right\rangle}{\left\langle w \right\rangle}

    and an accurate bootstrap estimate of the left-hand side requires tracking the correlations between the numerator and denominator.
    Moreover, quoting correlated uncertainties requires resampling different observables in the same way.

    Parameters
    ----------
        ensemble:   Ensemble
            The ensemble to resample.
        draws:      int
            The number of times to resample.

    Any :ref:`primary observables` that :class:`~.Ensemble` supports can be called from the :class:`~.Bootstrap`.
    :class:`~.Bootstrap` uses :code:`getattr` trickery under the hood to intercept calls and perform the weighted average transparently.

    Each observable returns an array of the same dimension as the ensemble's observable.  However, rather than configurations first, :code:`draws` are first.

    Each draw is a weighted average over the resampled weight, as shown above, and is therefore an estimator for the expectation value.
    These are guaranteed (by the `central limit theorem`_) to be normally distributed as long as you have not sinned.
    To get an uncertainty estimate one need only take the :code:`mean()` for a central value and :code:`std()` for the uncertainty on the mean.
