*************************
The No-Intersection Model
*************************


Jacobson observed that the standard Villain model supports an interesting modification which suppresses vortex intersection.

.. math ::
   :label: no-intersection

   S = (d\varphi - 2\pi n)^2 + i \theta_p (dn \wedge dn)_p

with $\theta$ a real-valued 4-form that when path-integrated enforces $dn \wedge dn = 0$.
The physical interpretation is that vortices may not intersect in this model.

The model has two $U(1)$ symmetries, the standard Villain $U(1)$ and the shift symmetry of $\theta$.
Remarkably, neither symmetry is anomalous on its own, but they have a mixed anomaly that is an axial-vector-vector anomaly in 4D, just like the ABJ anomaly!

This model must undergo a transition of some kind as you tune $\kappa$ but the character of that transition is unknown.
It may be first order.
There may be multiple boring (BKT-like) transitions that take us from one of the $U(1)$s being broken to the other.

But the most exciting possibility is that there is one continuous transition yielding an interesting CFT.
There are only so many 4D CFTs known with the right AVV anomaly structure, and they all include fermions.
It could be that this model is a back-door strategy for 4D bosonization!

The Topological Charge and the Constraint
=========================================

The no-intersection constraint asks that the topological-charge density $q_x$
(the same density measured by :class:`~supervillain.observable.TopologicalChargeDensity`)

.. math::

   q_x = (dn \wedge dn)_x = d(n \wedge dn)_x = (dJ)_x
   \qquad J = n \wedge dn

vanish on every hypercube.  The second equality is exact on the lattice (the
Leibniz rule and $d^2 = 0$ both hold), so $q$ is the divergence of the 3-form
current $J$ and is locally conserved and integer-valued.  A localized closed
$F = dn$ carries zero total charge $Q = \sum_x q_x$, so violations of the
constraint always come as a $+1$ / $-1$ dipole --- the fact that the
:class:`~supervillain.generator.no_intersection.ThetaWorm` exploits.

Generators
==========

The No-Intersection generators update $n$ while preserving $q = 0$; combine any
of them with a $\phi$-update (they are bundled with a
:class:`~supervillain.generator.villain.SiteUpdate` in the :func:`Hammer` below).
They are pure-python reference implementations restricted to $D = 4$.
