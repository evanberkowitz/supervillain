class ClassicWorm(ReadWriteable, Generator):
    r'''
    This implements the classic worm of Prokof'ev and Svistunov :cite:`PhysRevLett.87.160601` for the Villain links $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfy $dn \equiv 0 $ (mod W) on every plaquette.

    On top of a constraint-satisfying configuration we put down a worm and let the head move, changing the crossed links.
    We uniformly propose a move in all 4 directions and Metropolize the change.

    Additionally, when the head and tail coincide, we allow a fifth possible move, where we remove the worm and emit the updated $z$ configuration into the Markov chain.
    
    As we evolve the worm we tally the histogram that yields the :class:`~.Vortex_Vortex` correlation function.

    .. warning ::
        
        This update algorithm is not ergodic on its own.  It doesn't change $\phi$ at all and even leaves $dn$ alone (while changing $n$ itself).
        It can be used, for example, :class:`~.Sequentially` with the :class:`~.SiteUpdate` and :class:`~.LinkUpdate` for an ergodic method.

    .. note ::
        
        **Because** it doesn't change $dn$ at all, this algorithm can play an important role in sampling the $W=\infty$ sector, where all vortices are completely killed, though updates to $\phi$ would still be needed.

    .. note ::

        This class contains kernels accelerated using numba.

    .. seealso ::

        There is :class:`a reference implementation without any numba acceleration <supervillain.generator.reference_implementation.villain.ClassicWorm>`.
